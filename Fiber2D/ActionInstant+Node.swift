/**
 This action executes a code block. The block takes no parameters and returns nothing.
 
 @note This is meant to be instant action. If you will create this a continous one, the block will be called every frame.
 
 ### Passing Parameters
 
 Blocks can access all variables in scope, both variables local to the method as well as instance variables.

 Running a block is often preferable then using Target-Action pattern.
 
 ### Memory Management
 
 To avoid potential memory management issues it is recommended to use a weak self reference inside
 the block. If you are knowledgeable about [memory management with ARC and blocks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20030873/always-pass-weak-reference-of-self-into-block-in-arc)
 you can omit the weakSelf reference at your discretion. Otherwise use [unowned self] attribute in block
 
 ### Code Example
 
 Example block that reads and modifies a variable in scope and rotates a node to illustrate the code syntax:
 
 let callBlock = ActionCallBlock {[unowned self] () -> () in
  self.rotation += 90;
 }.instantly
 
 [self runAction:callBlock];
