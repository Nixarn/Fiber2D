/**
 CCSetup serves as the setup point for the application and prepares cocos2d to run with various platform specific settings.
 It exists outside of cocos scene management, and as such can be used to start application specific logic.
 
 An instance of this class (or a subclass) should be invoked from the entry point of execution for each platform. These points are:
 
 * AppDelegate#application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: (iOS)
 * AppDelegate#applicationDidFinishLaunching: (Mac)
 * CCActivity#run (Android)
  
 For SpriteBuilder projects the above files will be generated automatically with the correct invocations. 
 
 Caveats exist for Android, as unlike with other platforms the GL context is not initialized before the setup process begins. Care must 
 be taken not to perform setup logic that requires access to GL functions before initialization is complete.

*  Loads configCocos2D.plist from disk or returns a default dictionary.
*  Override to provide alternate configuration shared by all platforms.
*
*  Currently supported keys for the configuration dictionary are:
*  - `CCSetupPixelFormat`: NSString with the pixel format, normally `kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8` or `kEAGLColorFormatRGB565`. The RGB565 option is faster and recommended, unless color vibrancy is noticably impaired or you need the alpha channel.
*  - `CCSetupScreenMode`: NSString value that accepts either `CCScreenModeFlexible` or `CCScreenModeFixed`.
*  - `CCSetupScreenOrientation`: NSString value that accepts `CCScreenOrientationLandscape`, `CCScreenOrientationPortrait`, or `CCScreenOrientationAll`.
*  - `CCSetupAnimationInterval`: NSNumber with double. Specifies the desired interval between animation frames. Supported values are `1.0/60.0` (default, 60 fps) and `1.0/30.0` (30 fps).
*  - `CCSetupFixedUpdateInterval`: NSNumber with double. Specifies the desired interval between fixed updates. Should be smaller than `CCSetupAnimationInterval`. Defaults to `1.0/60.0` (60 Hz).
*  - `CCSetupShowDebugStats`: NSNumber with bool. Specifies if the stats (FPS, frame time and draw call count) should be rendered. Defaults to NO.
*  - `CCSetupTabletScale2X`: NSNumber with bool. If true, the iPad will be setup to act like it has a 512x384 points "logical" screen size with a "Retina" pixel resolution of 1024x768.
*      This makes it much easier to make universal iOS games. This is the default mode for SpriteBuilder projects. This value is ignored when using the fixed screen mode.
*  - `CCSetupDepthFormat`: NSNumber with integer. Specifies the desired depth buffer format. Values are 0 (no depth buffering), `GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_OES` (8-Bit depth buffer) and `GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24_OES` (24-bit depth buffer).
*      Depth buffering is only needed in rare cases and comes at the expense of performance and additional memory usage.
*  - `CCSetupPreserveBackbuffer`: NSNumber with bool. Specifies whether backbuffer will be preserved. Defaults to NO.
*  - `CCSetupMultiSampling`: NSNumber with bool. Specifies whether multisampling (fullscreen anti-aliasing) is enabled. Defaults to NO.
*  - `CCSetupNumberOfSamples`: NSNumber with integer. Specifies number of samples when multisampling is enabled. Ignored if multisampling is not enabled.
