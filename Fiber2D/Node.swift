/** Node is the base class for all objects displayed by Fiber2D. Node handles transformations, can have a content size and provides a coordinate system
 for its child nodes.
 
 ### Node Hierarchy
 
 Nodes are hierachically organized in a tree with a Scene as its root node. This is often referred to as *scene graph*, *node hierarchy* or *node tree*.
 
 By default every node can have other nodes as child nodes. Some node classes restrict child nodes to a specific instance type, or don't allow child nodes at all.
 
 A child node is positioned and rotated relative to its parent. Some properties of the parent node are "inherited" by child nodes, for example: scale, visible, paused.
 Other properties are only "inherited" if enabled, see cascadeOpacityEnabled for example.
 
 ### Draw Order
 
 Draw order of nodes is controlled primarily by their order in the node hierarchy. The parent node is drawn first, followed by its child nodes in the order they
 were added.
 
 You can fine-tune draw order via the zOrder property. By default all nodes have a zOrder of 0. Nodes with lower zOrder are drawn before nodes with higher zOrder.
 This applies only to nodes in the same level (sibling nodes) and their parent node, as the zOrder is relative to the zOrder of the parent.
 
 Assuming you have two parent nodes A and B with zOrder 0 and they are drawn in the order A first, then B. Then all of the children of parent B will be drawn
 in front of any child node of parent A. If B's zOrder is changed to -1, then parent B and all of its children will be drawn behind parent A and its children.
 
 ### Scheduling Events / Timers
 
 You can use the various schedule methods of a node, such as schedule(block:delay:).
 
 **Warning:** Any non-Fiber2D scheduling methods will be unaffected by the node's paused state and may run in indeterminate order, possibly causing rendering
 glitches and timing bugs. It is therfore strongly discouraged to use NSTimer, `performSelector:afterDelay:` or Grand Central Disptach (GCD) `dispatch_xxx` methods
 to time/schedule tasks in Fiber2D.
 
 #### Pausing
 
 It is common practice to pause the topmost node of a layer whose contents you want to pause. For instance you should have a gameLayer node that you can use
 to pause the entire game, while the hudLayer and pauseMenuLayer nodes may not need to or shouldn't be paused in order to continue animations and allowing the
 user to interact with a pause menu.
 
 ### Input Handling
 
 Any Node or subclass can receive touch and mouse events, if enabled. See the Responder super class for more information.
 
 ### Position and Size Types
 
 Coordinates in the Node coordinate system are by default set in points by the position property. The point measurement provides a way to handle different
 screen pixel densities. For instance, on a Retina device one point corresponds to two pixels, but on non-Retina devices point and pixel resolution are identical.
 
 By using the positionType property you can specify how a node's position is interpreted. For instance, if you set the type to PositionTypeNormalized a
 position value of (0.5, 0.5) will place the node in the center of its parent's container. The container is specified by the parent's contentSize.
 
 It's also possible to set positions relative to the different corners of the parent's container. The PositionType has three components, xUnit, yUnit and corner.
 The corner can be any reference corner of the parent's container and the xUnit and yUnit can be any of the following:
 
 - .points - This is the default, the position value will be in points.
 - .scaled - The position is scaled by the UIScaleFactor as defined by Director. This is very useful for scaling up game play without changing the game logic.
 E.g. if you want to support both phones and tablets in native resolutions.
 - .normalized - Using the normalized type allows you to position object in relative to the parents container. E.g. it can be used to center nodes
 on the screen regardless of the device type your game is running on.
 
 Similarily to how you set a node's position and positionType you can also set it's contentSize and contentSizeType. However, some classes doesn't allow you
 to set these directly. For instance, the Sprite sets its contentSize depending on the size of its texture and for descendants of Control you should
 set the preferredSize and preferredSizeType rather than changing their contentSize directly. The SizeType has two components widthUnit and heightUnit
 which can be any of the following:
 
 - .points - This is the default, the size will be in points
 - .scaled - The size is scaled by the UIScaleFactor.
 - .normalized - The content size will be set as a normalized value of the parent's container.
 - .inset - The content size will be the size of it's parent container, but inset by a number of points.
 - .insetScaled - The content size will be the size of it's parent container, but inset by a number of points multiplied by the UIScaleFactor.
 
 Even if the positions and content sizes are not set in points you can use actions to animate the nodes. See the examples and tests for more information on
 how to set positions and content sizes, or use SpriteBuilder to easily play around with the settings. There are also more positioning options available
 by using Layout and LayoutBox.
 
 #### Prefer to use ..InPoints
 
 There are typically two properties of each property supporting a "type". For instance the position property returns the raw values whose meaning
 depends on positionType, while positionInPoints will return the position in points regardless of positionType. It is recommended to use the "inPoints"
 variants of properties if you expect the values to be in points.
 
 Otherwise your code will break if you subsequently change the positionType to something other than points (ie UIPoints or Normalized).
 
 ### Subclassing Notes
 
 A common pattern in building a Fiber2D game is to subclass Node, add it to a Scene and override the methods for handling user input.
 Consider each node subclass as being the view in a MVC model, but it's also the controller for this node and perhaps even the node's branch of the node tree.
 The model can also be represented by the node subclass itself, or made separate (M-VC model).
 
 A separate model could simply be any NSObject class initialized by the node subclass and assigned to an ivar/property.
 
 An advanced subclassing style aims to minimize subclassing node classes except for Node itself. A Node subclass acts as the controller for its node tree,
 with one or more child nodes representing the controller node's views. This is particularly useful for composite nodes, such as a player
 with multiple body parts (head, torso, limbs), attachments (armor, weapons) and effects (health bar, name label, selection rectangle, particle effects).
